"""THE LOOP — observe → reason → act → repeat. This file is the whole trick.

Every agent framework is ultimately this while-loop with more indirection:

    while not done:
        response = llm(messages, tools)          # reason
        if response asks for tools:
            results = run(tool_calls)            # act
            messages += results                  # observe
        else:
            done                                 # reply to the human

End-loop guardrails (the orange box's exit conditions):
  1. the model stops asking for tools  → natural end of turn
  2. max_iterations reached            → hard stop, never spin forever
